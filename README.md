# ichimouku-cloud-breakout
This is a code repository that stores various codes to run the algorithmic trading strategy based on the ichimouku cloud strategy
1)first run the stock ticker to generate a list of csv file filter to around 2000 stocks(pick the appropriate stock market
2)next run either the volume(unusual volume) or breakout(conversion line crossed above base line)
3)pass the panda dataframe through your brokerage

Note!: the file is incomplete, there would be no code of the brokerage as it conatins sensitive information
I would recommend using Tigerbrokers API

Using the Ichimokou strategy has a win rate of 53%, and it is a momentum strategy
Lastly, the weightage is incomplete,
future projects would include sentimental analysis and financial analysis
